﻿/// An example Command
/// ============================
/// This Command puts a new ExampleView into the scene.
/// Note how the ContextView (i.e., the GameObject our Root was attached to)
/// is injected for use.
/// 
/// All Commands must override the Execute method. The Command is automatically
/// cleaned up when Execute has completed, unless Retain is called (more on that
/// in the OpenWebPageCommand).
